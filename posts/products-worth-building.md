:::tldr
As AI keeps improving, the bottleneck has shifted from "can I build this?" to "should I build this?" Most prompt-first products, from GPT wrappers to one-off image apps, may spike for a moment but rarely stay sticky because their core value is easily replicated. The real opportunity is building products that gather context from how people actually live and work, then clearly reward that input over time with better, more specific intelligence. The apps worth building are the ones that get more useful the longer you use them, where context becomes the moat and personalization becomes the reason users keep coming back.

As AI keeps accelerating, many of the assumptions around building products have to change. Engineers like me used to ask, "Can I build this product?" Now the better question is, "Should I build this product?" Code is no longer the blocker for creating new software, and as models keep improving, products built on top of them inherit those gains automatically.

The easiest way to feel chat model progress is to build a chat app, the so-called GPT wrappers that exploded in early 2023. But most of those apps were not sticky. Many climbed the App Store charts for a day or two and then disappeared. They may have changed output slightly, but the core experience stayed adjacent to frontier lab products.

We are past the point where simple chat interfaces can break into the mainstream in a lasting way. The same thing happened with image apps that turned people into anime characters; they faded once users realized they could do the same thing inside ChatGPT and Gemini. Products whose core value can be replicated with one or two prompts are hard to sustain.

That can feel discouraging, but there is still a lot of opportunity left. Humans have too many preferences, habits, and day-to-day decisions that AI still does not see. It does not know the choices you made, does not retain meaningful personal context unless you feed it continuously, and only learns from the narrow set of interactions most people actually have with it. That missing context is where the next wave of AI products will come from.

Developers should build AI experiences around context gathered outside core AI flows. One example I am currently exploring is an AI nutrition and strength coach. After I started lifting consistently a couple months ago, I kept going to ChatGPT with questions about specific exercises, macros, and changes I noticed in my body. The answers were useful, but never fully exact. I usually ended up with multiple possible directions depending on which variables I emphasized.

Problems like this are driving my current line of exploration: how can we use unused context from daily life to deliver more tailored and specific experiences across domains? You can easily imagine an AI coach that correlates your weight, exercise, and nutrition and can answer questions on demand, or an AI co-worker that knows the long-term context of a project and is not limited to a single chat thread.

The first challenge is building an app that is useful enough for users to keep sharing context over time. A heavy onboarding that asks for everything up front usually pushes people away before they even sign up. The product **itself** has to naturally encourage meaningful input. The second challenge is returning obvious value from that input; if the AI does not become more useful as context grows, the app is basically just a note.

The products worth building are the ones that improve the more you live with them. Every workout logged, link shared, decision made, and action taken becomes context that makes the AI smarter about **you**. That becomes the moat. Context creates switching costs not because users are trapped, but because the product is already tailored to them. In an age where anyone can ship an app in a weekend, the edge is no longer just being able to build. It is knowing what is worth building.
